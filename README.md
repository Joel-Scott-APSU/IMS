# Inventory Management System (C#)

A desktop-based inventory management application built in C# that allows
small store owners to track, update, and manage inventory without requiring
a database engine. The project focuses on object-oriented design, persistent
storage, and user-friendly desktop interfaces.

## Overview

This application was developed to manage inventory items using structured
JSON files for persistence. It supports tracking item details such as quantity,
pricing, and identifiers, while allowing users to add, edit, remove, and sort
inventory entries through an intuitive desktop UI.

The project emphasizes clean separation of concerns, data validation, and
maintainable code structure.

## Key Features

- Add, edit, and remove inventory items
- Track item quantity, pricing, and identifiers
- Persistent storage using JSON files
- Sorting and filtering of inventory data
- Automatic file management for stored inventory
- Desktop-based user interface

## Architecture Highlights

- Object-oriented domain model for inventory items
- JSON-based persistence layer (no database required)
- Input validation and error handling
- Separation between UI logic and data management

## Tech Stack

- C#
- .NET
- Windows Forms / WPF
- JSON file I/O

## My Contributions

- Designed the object model for inventory items
- Implemented JSON-based persistence and file management
- Built the desktop UI and input workflows
- Added validation and error handling for user input
- Structured the application using OOP principles

## Running the Application

A compiled executable is available under **Releases**.
This project is intended to demonstrate desktop application design,
data persistence, and object-oriented programming concepts.
